Ruby ID3 Sort

The idea of this program is to take an unsorted music folded and move all the tracks to a destination based on the ID3 tagging.

it is executed by:
ruby music_parser.rb origin destination enact
e.g.
ruby music_parser.rb /home/TheDevelopment/unsorted /home/TheDevelopment/Music enact

By removing the 'enact' word, the program does a dry run.
